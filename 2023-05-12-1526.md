Have been wanting to get back into making more indie hardware projects but with more of a climate focus. Soooo starting with a little air quality tracker I can carry with me using #sensor/SCD41 for air quality and RasPi Pico H with datalogger.

Reminder on getting started:

1. Put in DFU mode by pressing `reset` button
2. Flash controller CircuitPython for PicoH [firmware](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)
3.

```

```
