I wanted to create a template that connects to MFE data so that when working with people I Kyle or others in the future, I have something I can quickly spin up to prototype that interacts with that project. So far I started two projects:

## MFE Data 
(Server with an interface for getting an API Key and browsing data)



## Example/ template client 





![[CleanShot 2023-08-23 at 23.01.05.png]]
The set up I'm playing with is laying out the server on the left and the interface for that while keeping the example project on the right. Both of them built with the new nextjs app directories so should be a little bit more future-proof than what I knew how to make before. 


The current implementation just uses, is the authentication header of an API request to insert a Barra token, which is then looked up in the database. Or time would be nice to create an API key and a secret through JWT and have that be able to pass back and forth. But it feels like a good first pass to have something that is secured.

Next for the MFE Data Template I'll use a basic tailwinds ui of a dashboard but styled like Carbon Plan.

Starting with a basic template for making projects that interface with mfe-data but are stand-alone, like the project with Kyle.


Two clean projects 

MFE-Tool-Template
- Pulls data from the API for mfe-data
- Displaies data on a map
- auth
- can scrub that timeline via an app


MFE-Data
- Lists a collection of datasets
- tracks numer of times each datasets is requested
- has auth wich gives you dev key
- has search and filter optiosn for hsoted data sets 


Datapoint - A grop of data imported to

Data set - a cluster or relted datapoints uploaded at the same time form the same source

Collections - A series 



### Shareable Search URL
Making a new SearchPage at `app/search/page.tsx` 

```tsx
// app/search/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useRouter, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import Spinner from "./Spinner";
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetchPosts = async (url: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(url);

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch posts");
  }

  return response.json();
};

const SearchPage = () => {
  const search = useSearchParams();
  const searchQuery = search ? search.get("q") : null;
  const router = useRouter();

  const encodedSearchQuery = encodeURI(searchQuery || "");

  const { data, isLoading } = useSWR(
    `/api/search?q=${encodedSearchQuery}`,
    fetchPosts,
    { revalidateOnFocus: false }
  );

  if (!encodedSearchQuery) {
    router.push("/");
  }

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Spinner />;
  }

  if (!data?.posts) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <span className="text-xl">
        Showing results for:{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">{searchQuery}</span>
      </span>
      <Posts posts={data.posts} />
    </>
  );
};

const Posts = ({ posts }: PostsProps) => {
  return (
    <>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div className="flex p-3 gap-4 my-3 rounded-xl border-[1px] border-zinc-600 w-3/4">
          <div></div>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <span className="text-xl font-semibold">{post.name}</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default SearchPage;

```




Using the amazona example add pass in a dropdown and tag options into search

```
```




 
Now you can share a search url like http://localhost:3001/search?q=trends however we need to add in tags and filters next. And this method uses the older `pages/api` routes instead of the newer `routes` method which is more alighted with the `app/` directory build style. Perhaps [search-nextjs13](https://github.com/batuhanbilginn/search-nextjs13) example of search-params could work as a upgrade to this in a future release

Then add in filters
Using [nextjs-fullstack-search](https://github.com/shadeemerhi/nextjs-fullstack-search/tree/main) learn how to pass a `input` field data into the url. 

```
```


```
```






Abstrack this into a component which can be aused across all pages


OK, I got an
