Sf tree sense is 

Spirit tree 


Accidentally rescheduled my therapy appointment. Thought it was yesterday. Turned out it was today. 

It felt kind of weird being back at A Seph event. This one was pretty non-overly techy. Genuinely felt like Cool side projects and explorations things. Made me want to think about getting better at publishing what I think about. Still feeling a little alone. And wanting to see what Pamâ€™s up too. We usuallyh talk every day so not talking in three days feels like a silly thing to feel weird about. But does feel funny.
