# How can Data.MF.E R0 become more focused

Shifting from a daily to a weekly note structure has been effective. But as I balance building out what feels necessary for the MVP of the API, the rabbit holes of trying new things are my fuel, but they also delay the work on valuable items sometimes. Maybe this isn’t true, but it’s how it feels.

Focused work on MFE still feels like it should be on making #mfe/data/R0 a searchable list of known climate data sources. With excellent search and filtering based on data type, authority, and text descriptions. The link doesn’t host data other than the NASA trends data. (Maybe add any public earth science models too)

Then a #mfe/data/R1 update allows you to create an account, save/follow collections, connect a live sensor to the network,

#mfe/data/R2 could be quality control, uploading of static data sets, and other tools for remixing data in a glitch.com way.

Something along these lines feels valuable, but I need to start reaching out to others who need this type of data and find a few contracts, like the fruit trees farming risk tool I have started to flush out. These will need the datasets in [[MFE R.0 Data]] and these projects have a more direct impact, which can be shown on [[MFE R.0]] too.
