If I were to write a science fiction book, it would be grounded in the narrative that humans finally make their way to Mars. But when we do, we discover that Mars was the first Earth. And we killed it. And humans never left the planet we couldn't; instead, we sent a version of ourselves to the world, seeing it could support life. But we never successfully traveled here. Because of travel, our mars system was already too damaged. So we send a seed pod marked by some of the mar for creators on earth to save our selves.
