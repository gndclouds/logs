Starting today, I will focus on regaining my cognitive and creative freedom as an Entrepreneur. This means that instead of treating personal projects as side projects, they will be what I dedicate my time to daily. Over the next year, I will work with a group of people to launch small products as part of a tribe we are calling [Tiny Factories](https://v5.gndclouds.cc/owning-your-cognitive-and-creative-freedom/). We are all writing about why we need to make this jump, and you can read more about the other team members, [Tomo](https://v5.gndclouds.cc/owning-your-cognitive-and-creative-freedom/) and [Weiwei](https://v5.gndclouds.cc/owning-your-cognitive-and-creative-freedom/). Please keep reading for my take on why now is the right time to jump!

Growing up, the notion of a job requiring me to invent new things sounded fantastic. Because invention required exploration, which guaranteed I would learn. Especially as a kid, I always wondered why things worked the way they did. So when I discovered a designer's job was to design all the things I was questioning, my path became clear. As my interests matured, Design was the best available path and was a way to start regaining my creative freedom.

As I advanced in school, it quickly felt like the point was to game the system and convince the teachers I knew what the textbooks said down to every word, even if there was no understanding of the why or how. So, the older I got, the less exploration; thus, learning took place. So, it wasn’t until college that my creativity was reset. Now, I could start inventing again with this newly found lens of design. And in doing so, understand how the physical and digital worlds could blend. It was a safe place; in fact, there was almost no connection with the natural world at all other than two internships. But even those felt safe, and it wasn’t until graduation that I discovered how little creative freedom I had.

Eight months after graduation, any sense of creative freedom was snuffed out again. Every contract I signed stuck me into a little box and told me to focus on one task. But what the last three years ultimately showed me is that all the designers I was inspired by weren’t just designers but Entrepreneurs. They built companies around their products, and today, it feels like that has all but disappeared as many design teams move in-house. But for me today, I’m regaining my cognitive and creative freedom permanently. For me, announcing Tiny Factories is the first step in making that a reality. Our team will be working on shipping a product a month for the following year. We will create a community and eventually fund other indie makers along the way. So, with my design experience, I’m excited to begin working with [Tomo](https://v5.gndclouds.cc/owning-your-cognitive-and-creative-freedom/) and [Weiwei](https://v5.gndclouds.cc/owning-your-cognitive-and-creative-freedom/) full-time.

If any of these thoughts interest you, I would be delighted to hear why, and even if they aren’t, I would still be interested. Feel free to message me on Twitter.
