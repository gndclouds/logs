Frequently, I don't publish my work because it doesn't meet a certain quality bar that I want my work to have in the world. But I've been trying to find new ways to get back to the mentality I had at school, in which I was significantly scrappier and published smaller things more frequently. While thinking about what this could look like for [[Inter Tidal]] I wanted to document the process used to make a storyboard to capture the core ideas around the concept.

First, we start to look at what type of style we would want to use and how would mid-journey use 'describe that style'.

Then we ran that prompt to see how close it was to the original before tweaking it.

Next, we need to start specifying the type of shot we might want to create so we removed a *table filled with things to eat in front of the sun*, and added in *plankton floating in the ocean*.

Next, we needed to start on a shot list for the story to get a more detailed visual style that we could carry through the narrative.

Then we could explore a new version of the prompts which help us start to get those types of shots as shown bellow.
