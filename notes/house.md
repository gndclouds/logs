house is a project from [o.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20190129225952/http://gndclouds.cc/house/ohdotzero.co) (oh dot zero) focused on the long-term dwelling of humans on Earth. Phase one is a year-long research phase looking at how to decentralize all public utilities. We are working with [Utopia](https://web.archive.org/web/20190129225952/http://gndclouds.cc/house/#), [Stone Edge Micro-grid](https://web.archive.org/web/20190129225952/http://gndclouds.cc/house/#), and [Center for Art and Public Life](https://web.archive.org/web/20190129225952/http://gndclouds.cc/house/#) at [California College of the Arts](https://web.archive.org/web/20190129225952/http://gndclouds.cc/house/#) to bring this into the world.
  

**Scope**
What do we mean by "decentralize all public utilities"? If you want water, power, waste, or communication to be available at home, you must connect to your city's or county's utility grid. We are researching a future in which you can be separated from that grid system. This sounds like a micro-grid, but are thinking even more localized to the scale of one structure. Our focus is on the pico grid, or a grid that can service all traditional public utility needs of one household. We are developing a "core" to maintain and manage all your utilities to achieve this.

**Upcycling Structures**
When looking at Existing structures, we looked at how to retrofit homes more excellent than 30 years old and homes that needed repair after natural disasters. Should we modify existing homes?

**New Construction**
We kept hearing about how many people were moving to cities and wanted to understand what that meant. Are these people living closer to cities or in them?

**Nomad**
What if we started over from scratch and completely changed how we thought of a home?
