## **🗞 News**

_What is our team working on behind the scenes and in public._

**Earth API**

![Screenshot of EarthAPI interface the Worlds first REST API for Greenhouse Gas Emission Data. (We Googled it)](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LfvlbUBK5dqV-hQxiRV5J9TwN-nsJJna4WjSlNRHjZBXO6bfpMrZVzVYsVOKBzVtQ003i1cLfNTdUXxnOxz0xXb7qMvohrEpxH2oGt2GTUYFrnz5Cr9R0cSAhvo_I_Aj25xO--JfW1LdKPzCK4qbDg)

Everything humans do affects the ecosystems around us. And with many of the earth's life support systems at tipping points, there is a need for greater accessibility and modernization of how we use climate data and what we are building and researching. [Earth API](https://hge.earth/) creates more accessibility to earth science data.
