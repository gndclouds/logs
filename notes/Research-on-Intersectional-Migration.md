A variety of species surrounds us, and yet the focus of our attention tends to be on our species. As we make our way through our day, year, and life, we are crossing paths with numerous species.

To learn more about who they are and how our patterns intersect, we made a map that visualized our intersections based on the time of year and location.    


Why

An exploration of the #unseen-seen by showing us what other species we share our environment with seasonally. 

To start, we are making a map site that shows your location and allows you to see an overlay of other species that share the same space at some point in the year. We can use gbif.org/species/API to query a list for our database or pull theirs depending on how their geoJson is structured.



History of 


Next, you can see species that should be around you based on the current date. It would be cool to integrate with naturists to encourage members to capture species as they notice them. Drawing influence from  Pok√©dex and [Ash](https://www.finh.cc/ash), you could collect stamps when you upload an image from your device that documents a species.
