We are surrounded by a variety of species, and yet the focus of our attention tends to be on our species. As we make out way through our day, our year, our life we are crossing paths with numerous species.

As a way to learn more about who they are and how we our own patterns intersect we made a map that visulized our interesctions based on a time of year and locaiton.    


Why

An exploration of the #unseen-seen by showing us what other species we share our environment with seasonally. 

To start, we are making a map site that shows your location and allows you to see an overlay of other species that share the same space at some point in the year. We can use the gbif.org/species/API to make a query a list for our own database or maybe just pull frim theirs depending on how their geoJson is structured.



Historey of 


Next, you can see species which should be around you right no based on the current date. It would be cool to have an integration with naturists to encourage members to capture species as they notice them. Drawing influence from  Pok√©dex and [Ash](https://www.finh.cc/ash) you could collect stamps when you upload an image from your device which documents a species.
