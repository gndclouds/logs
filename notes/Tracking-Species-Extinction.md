Started Reading [[Insolvent]] was caught by this quote,

*One million animal and plant species are now on the fast track to extinction*

That number just feels so massive. So I started a little research rabbit hole and twitter thread.

# Main Organizations:

1. [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]: This is one of the most comprehensive sources for information on the global extinction risk of species. The list categorizes species based on their extinction risk, ranging from “Least Concern” to “Critically Endangered.”
2. [[BirdLife International]]: Focuses primarily on birds, and it provides detailed assessments of the conservation status of bird species worldwide.
3. [[CITES]] (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora): While its primary focus is regulating the international trade of wildlife species, its Appendices provide lists of species that are at various levels of extinction risk.
4. [[EDGE of Existence]]: This program, run by the Zoological Society of London, identifies and conserves the world’s most Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species.
5. [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF): While not a database per se, WWF often releases reports and data on threatened and endangered species.
6. [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] (GBIF): An international platform that provides access to data about all types of life on Earth, including data related to threatened species.![[Pasted image 20231003111414.png]]
7. [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]: This is an open-access digital library that provides literature on biodiversity. You can find various publications about species, some of which touch on their risk of extinction.
8. [[NatureServe Explorer]]: An online database that provides comprehensive conservation information on more than 70,000 plants, animals, and ecosystems of the United States and Canada.

When using these sources, it’s essential to cross-reference information and always check for the most recent updates. The status of species can change as new research is conducted and as environmental conditions evolve. If you’re looking for real-time community assistance, consider reaching out on platforms like Reddit, ResearchGate, or specialized forums related to conservation and biodiversity.
