I was talking with Pam about the [[Swek Commons]] grant and wanted to know what it would look like to add a personality to the [[Living Data Pod]]. What you see right now in all of these self-driving car companies in San Francisco is that each has a unique name to give the car some sense of personal Identity. I would like to know if we can elevate the conversation between human actions and the natural state by using AI to create a persona for objects like the living data pod to have more dialogue with them when something happens. 

For example, maybe a [[Living Data Pod]] says one day, “There’s a lot of weird algae around me today,” or “Oh my goodness, all these little krill have started swimming by me.” Maybe it’s a way to help make the #unseen-seen by creating a space to dialog with [[nature states]]. Then, we can have some form of a conversation with nature.

A way to play with this idea is to use the [[3rd Street Sensors]], so make a little living creature for Dad's condo.
