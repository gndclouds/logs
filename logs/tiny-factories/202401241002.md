I am starting to work on [[CAFOs Mapper]] and want to understand what the current space of image labeling looks like for large data sets. The two options which look the most compelling as of 2024-01-24 are [[v7]] and [[Labelbox]]. There was a [starting dataset](https://reglab.stanford.edu/data/cafo-training-dataset/) I found based on a 2019 Stanford Study where they explored if image models could be used to count CAFOs but it looks like the project stopped after the paper was published. So I'm curiouse if we could automate and maintain this type of project today. I'm going to focus on how to tag the dataset in this log on both platforms to see which one would be best to move forward with in future [[Made For Earth]] projects.

The Stanford Datasette has a training and test set of images, which I think will be great for figuring out a baseline to then use in a future iteration where we use land data directly thought [NASA's DELTA](https://deltax.jpl.nasa.gov/science/overview/) program.
