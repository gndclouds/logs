1. **Open Your Mesh in Blender:**
    - Ensure you have your mesh file imported into Blender.
2. **Select the Mesh:**
    - Right-click on the mesh to ensure it's selected. If the object is not in Edit mode, press `Tab` to switch to Edit mode.
3. **Separate by Loose Parts:**
    - With the mesh selected in Edit mode, press `P` to open the Separate menu. Here, you have several options, but to separate each disconnected part of the mesh into its own object, choose "By Loose Parts".
4. **Exit Edit Mode:**
    - Once the separation is done, press `Tab` again to go back to Object mode. You will see that what was once a single mesh is now separated into individual objects based on disconnected geometry.
5. **Rename and Organize (Optional):**
    - After separation, each new object will have a generic name. You might want to rename them for better organization. To do this, select each object in Object mode, then go to the Object Data Properties tab and rename each object accordingly.
6. **Adjust Origins (Optional):**
    - After separation, the origins of the new objects might not be where you want them. To adjust, select an object, go to Object menu > Set Origin, and choose the most suitable option for your needs, like "Origin to Geometry".
7. **Move to Different Collections (Optional):**
    - For further organization, you might want to move each object to different collections. To do this, select an object, press `M`, and choose an existing collection or create a new one.
