I recently started using Tailscale, as [[James V]] recommended, to connect to devices at home when I'm away remotely. I was looking to use the ledger as my pass key solution, but it's proven inconsistent and doesn't work well over NFC. So, for now, moving on to ordering some more official keys.

Apple requires you to add two to your account if you choose to use that as a way to authenticate and recover all your Apple accounts. I take this opportunity to also download my own recovery key to Apple can't unencrypt my data anymore only I can.
