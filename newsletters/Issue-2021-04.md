# Learnings: 

This month we held our first in-person Tiny Gathering in Taiwan. It was very informal and we met a lot of new friends. It made me excited to hold more in-person events in the future.

# Conversations:

Lately, it feels like most conversations have been with me as I edit the copy on my website. It’s always been a tricky thing for me because I want the site to feel like it is for me but job hunting is mostly for someone else.

# Creations:

First Impressions - Pimoroni created a 7-color e-ink display that uses python. And I created a small guide on multiverse for helping you get started. The guides use a modified example with a collection of example functions to help you personalize the display quickly. The code lives on Github and every so often I add a new service to the frame. Let me know if there are any you would like to see.

Field Notes from Taipei - I observing new environments when I travel and started keeping small journals of what stands out to me. This week I made a mini-site where they can start to live outside of Twitter. My next step would be to add a mapping layer to connect you to the locations of the sights, sounds, and videos.

# Recommendations:

Gumption by Nick Offerman - Focuses on a collection of American figures who display high levels of gumption in how they go through their life.

Nintendo Builder Garage - Let you make mini-games similar to their LABO product, but without the cardboard and more control over in-game logic.
