# Learnings:

I have been working on migrating many of my tools to using primarily open-source or indie projects when possible. So this month, I moved the letter from Substack to ButtonDown Email, which allows for more customization!

# Conversations:

This past week some friends rented a studio space in Brooklyn, NY, and it made me excited to work towards having an in-person studio again in the future. One of the projects they wanted to build out was attaching a small train to the ceiling, mapped to the local MTA line closest to the building. I liked the idea of representing more real-world events with physical objects and not just screens.Creations:There were lots of slow work-in-progress updates this month. I have been working more consistently on developing the public-facing version of the Tiny Factories community with a project called TinyGarden, which has now has a development log.We are also taking on clients at Tiny Factories, and I have been exploring what the service offerings could look like and how we want to keep the community involved in the research we produce.

# Recommendations

- Living in Data by Jer Thorp gives a nice summary of his personal work and how we could be thinking about data science in ways that directly address biases.
- What is Golf is a spontainouse and unperdictubale golfing experience on most major mobile platforms. It was created by Triband and has been a great help in destressing my days. By far the best game I have played in 2021.
