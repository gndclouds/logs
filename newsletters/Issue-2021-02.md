# Learnings:

February has been a slow month as I think about how to better scope small projects and meet my expectations for doing more climate-related work. I have about 6 projects in various states and am starting to find more collaborators to ship them this next month.

# Conversations:

I spent a lot of time talking with professors and mentors to get a better understanding of what type of position is best suited for my current skills. The current thinking is that I should work at a company in the climate space to build my network and learn more about it. I’m not fully sold on this yet but am looking at a mix of personal projects, development jobs, and design jobs as I transition into climate work.

# Creations:

TinyGarden - A microblogging platform for Tiny Factories which will soon be open to the public. We have had a consistent interest in our growing discord community and wanted to make a more public space to engage with indie makers.

gndclouds.cc - It’s been a while since I actively maintained a site and portfolio of work. I did a small design update and started to include more recent work on my site. So it should be a reliable place to see all the new and old things I have worked on.

Futureland Tea Journal  - A new Futureland journal documenting types of tea.

Futureland Health Journal - Another public journal for all of us to keep each other motivated in staying healthy.

# Recommendations:

Epic Measures - Thinking about the scale of issues like the pandemic or the eradication of a disease is a complex systemic challenge. This autobiography talks about how the global health standards and metrics used by the World Health Organisation started.

The Easiest Person to Fool - As I was spending much of this month working on reshaping my workflow, this podcast helped me be more realistic with my expectations on work and life balance.

Sherlock - To relax more I rebooted the BBC production of Sherlock which has held up well and continues to be one of my favorite and most unpredictable narratives I have ever seen in a drama.

That’s it! Now off to get some tea.
