Two things I've been trying to understand this week better. Is there any stress around going to Barcelona, and why don't you think I want to do Flex House with Ben?

I'm still anxious about having a cofounder again and having an ownership stake in a company. It doesnt makes sense for me to continue working on that project because I'm doing it energetically and not because I have the intention of wanting to do that type of work. It's indirectly climate-related, and it's hard for me right now to see the value of working in an air face. They won't let me get to more significant climate decisions for several years; instead of working on those problems now, like mycelium insulation for example. However, I'm in a financial situation where I need to find work quickly, so I would like to know if there is an in-between option where I can be paid as a CTO but not take equity. That would be unusual, but I want to be able to separate from the company quickly.

As for Barcelona, I think I can easily take Pam talking through uncertainty personally when it is, instead, just a way of her processing things. Well, I don't think I know. But I still wonder if I should reduce my engagement with her on projects and life. I also feel guilty and don't have much going for me now. And I noticed at time the some of the insecurities I can see or feel from here seam tobe things she mentions as a way to distance me from her. Like adge, snoring, living alone, etc.

Anyhow just needed to externalize that a little.
