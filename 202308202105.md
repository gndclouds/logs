Usually these are for small research excursions. But I feel like now it’s a good time to reflect a little bit. I am sitting on the floor in Pam‘s living room, watching inside man and trying to not focus on my anxiety around nothing in particular, but just life overall.

I feel like things financially have not worked out in the way that I was hoping they would both from the continuous technology project and needing to take them to small claims court, figuring out how to navigate a California labor commissioner to get the Jason and Anthropogenic stuff settled, and the unknowns behind building flex house with Ben which I still have hesitations about. 

From a financial perspective, I think all of us collectively makes it feel like I’m back at where I was again burning through savings and not making notable financial progress as I age. I think last year was a great time for me to grow emotionally and I do feel that that happened, in terms of how I see myself and other people new boundaries that I would like to build deeper friendships with. Just a lot of perfect things about learning more energy stuff. And I’m happy I had space to do all of that, but it’s still hard for me to feel, the pressure that I put on myself of wanting to have been further somewhere by now. Or more of a fear of looking back and feeling like I should be further somewhere by now, even though I don’t feel that. I think the closest thing I can compare to some thing I was describing to Zoe  This past week around how looking back on the relationship with way. I think it was too much time, and I didn’t have the awareness of knowing that it had been too much time things not feeling like they were progressing in any meaningful way. And so I don’t want to have that type of reflective moment again because it was hard to distill the learnings down to a point where they felt justified for how much time seemed almost wasted in education but not executing things. I think it was just a timer things were out of balance, and I didn’t know or see how to rebalance it. 

But I’m trying to focus on learning how to know what emotions come in and move through me and then let go of them while trying to pay attention to things that might come in energetically. I still find incredible frustration when I get attached to something actively, and it doesn’t play out. For example, contracts with continuous were supposed to be easy money, yet I’ve had to get lawyers involved and spent $3000 athlete of lawyers to take them to small claims court, and in the end, it feels like anything but easy. And that shouldn’t be a surprise because I know energy shifts, and these things are constantly influenced by something just shifted. However, it’s still hard sometimes to detach from that expectation after learning to watch a potential energetic Path. 


I don’t know what to do about flex house because I am excited to make something with Ben and enthusiastic about the potential impact of whatever the company becomes at the scale. But I still find it hard to get motivated about the core concept, which isn’t some thing I would usually choose to pursue. I think the space of 3-D tools exciting but it’s not necessarily my direct space of interest anymore. **But maybe it isn’t supposed to be maybe it’s more about me being able to detach from that and fully lean into doing a particular role well**. #Learning-to-learn  so maybe I just need to come back to that.

I think therapies been helpful for helping me identify why I feel some of these things in a way in which I don’t feel guilty for feeling them.

I think the last part of life that is causing uncertainty in a way that I find stressful despite going with the flow of it, is not showing up as more than a friend for Pam. It’s funny because I can sense my mom‘s hesitation in my actions when I talk to her, but also the empathy of her understanding almost that she would do the same thing, and I think I appreciate her drawing that boundary. When we were in the airport, Kelly and I were returning from the Channel Islands, leaving Los Angeles. I asked her for her take because she had talked with my mom in the car about how I was interacting with Pam, And her perspective felt the most grounding because I didn’t feel like I was doing anything wrong. I know I wrote this down in a previous note, but my recollection as of now was that she shared something along the lines of that I should make sure I am also making all decisions for myself, and so maybe if I’m thinking about a decision , that doesn’t feel like it’s just for me it should always be 50% for me which I thought was kind of an interesting way to think about it. I think the other thing was her being ultra rational and being like what would you regret not doing it or not going to Barcelona or not continuing to be friends or not building in Depot relationship with Pam . Kelly‘s main point was like well. Well that’s what lovers. Of course you want to do all of this things for her and with her. Which felt like a really helpful realization to have externalized by her because in a weird way it felt like only I saw that . So I got me out of my head about it. Which Kelly is traditionally very good at doing. 

I think my current uncertainty stems from almost confusion of how things have evolved in a month to us being very close friends again down to the point of her asking if I would want to live in Barcelona with her for a couple months, which is one of the most exciting things I can imagine myself doing right now. And so there’s some hesitation in me and not being in an excellent financial place to do so, but I believe I still feel comfortable and I already committed to this. But I can at least help bring the cats over and potentially stay longer, which could be kind of a forced action depending on , when some of the business payments come in. I think the other part is I feel a little distance and isolated from Pam because even if I’m not at my best, I can usually show up for other people pretty effectively and I think her current level of stress and anxiety has not fully allowed her to shop for me, except in a kind of superficial way that I feel like I see her do with other people. So I’m attached a little bit too, what our relationship felt like last year when she was genuinely very present when she was asking me about myself, but I read this as a result of her being so preoccupied that she can’t show up for me in that way right now which makes me sad, but I also understand she has a lot of pressures and stresses at the moment.  But I would need to know that as the friendship continues to revolve, she can also make space for that. I want to find a way to bring this up with her because it feels odd not to discuss it with her.

I think the framing I have in my mind is just checking in and seeing if she’s doing OK and may be on the drive up from San Francisco. I can ask but I kind of want to ask the question.

Hey, can you tell me something? Well, that’s silly. I’m going to ask you something. I feel like communication has recently shifted a little, and I just want to make sure I’m reading things right. I understand from what you’ve shared that you are under various stressors, and this is a big move, both in terms of school and the cats in housing. Still, I noticed that in some of our recent conversations you will sometimes ask me how I am and then either change topic as I am describing how I am or not have anything to add to it. I can’t tell if that’s just because you’re you have all of these things going on or if you were asking more out of our politeness that an actually want to know how I am. I think it’s just like my intuition makes it feel like it’s just all of the things going on, but I wanted to ask because I feel like we’ve had other moments for years, very engaged with life something I share that’s stressing me out or some thing I’m certain about and you share really helpful and meaningful advice on what it is that you think I could be thinking about her having awareness of that might distress the situation. And I really value that and so I just was kind of curious if that’s just kind of because of everything that’s going on or something else that I’ve changed because I really liked that part of our friendship and  didn’t want it to go away but also just wanna make sure that I didn’t deny or share some thing or yeah. That’s a very Brady way to say it. 

*I think a cleaner and simpler way to introduce this might be something like hey, I have a question for you feel like the last couple weeks worth of conversations when you’ve asked me how I’m doing. I felt kind of weird because when I’ll ask if I start explaining how I’m doing Sometimes you’ll change topics as I am sharing or there won’t be any like follow up to what I share and my interpretation has been that that’s a byproduct of just everything that’s going on between moving in school and cats. Especially because I feel like I’ve had you do , a complete opposite of that we’ve been super like present and supportive and conversational about helping me talk through some thing that I’m stuck with her stuck on, and I really appreciated that part of our friendship and would like if it was still part of how we interact. But I just wanted to know if I was miss reading something or  if this is just kind of a result of everything that’s going on right now. #Question/pam #Question/therapy*

Anyhow, I think that’s most of it. I think I know the answer, but it would feel good to ask in person given that it feels straightforward and normal for us to have conversations like this now.
