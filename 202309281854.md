I don’t really know what to share or what I’m trying to say.

I don't really know what I'm trying to say. But I feel like I just need to share home feeling as a way to think through what's happening it's been really busy this time in Portland and it's been hard to find time to connect with Pam and her family. But today, I found some time to go help her just pack a few boxes. And I think there were a couple of things that came out of that experience that I feel like are worth paying attention to in some way. I was a little nervous going in, because I didn't want to get sucked back into like, missing her. So I tried to set a very clear intention of just making sure that I was entering the space for myself and neutrally and be very defensive almost of my energy. And I think that was largely successful. Some things I picked up on though was reflecting on something Melissa said of sometimes she almost speaks as if there's a weak and I feel like that happened there has happened in the past when like, for example, I was dealing with all of the cat stuff and we thought the cat needed surgery and there was that whole thing. And she was like, Well, what can you make a decision? And my response was, but he's not like he's not my cat. It's not my place to make a decision, which is interesting, because it's like saying something about that there's a certain point of trust and it's also saying something about for wanting to maybe take ownership or be responsible for a potential outcome. as well. I think the other layer was that today. I wanted something to feel resolved. I wanted to feel certain or not certain. And instead everything just feels kind of neutral.

Like it was good to see her. Her energy was happy to see me. But you could also tell she was just distracted by all the moving stuff going on and still didn't really have anything more solid to go off of in terms of where she was going or when she was going somewhere. And when she was listing some of the places she wanted to go it's almost like it felt like she was waiting for like a more dramatic response or reaction for me. And yet, since I started to back away a little bit, I feel like the shift in energy has been pretty notable. I've had a lot more like friend interactions come in and there's been a lot more like spaces and opportunities for me to just collaborate. Or like everything for me meeting random people on Twitter that are reaching out to just connecting with you know, more distant friends it just feels like there's more things moving around me in some senses so there's that. I think the thing that is tricky is I really like it when she talks as if there's a we, I mean, it's a profound thing to have someone do that. With you or about you and think that experience is something I miss. I miss being able to have a moment in which it feels like I'm part of a we just a nice feeling you know my mother is sure of was really nice to see Margie and the girls for a bit. Like that just feels good. I enjoy seeing them. I mean it's fun. interacting with them. They're adorable. There's like they feel like family and friends like it's it's super enjoyable to be around them and I can't tell if I'm just drifted through the house. tired or burnt out? Or? I think my energy's a little low from dealing with all of Misha shit I'm I know I'm going to be sad that I don't know when I'll see Pam again in person or the girls trying to understand why I want something to feel resolved. I think it's the getting pulled in and feeling that we the moments of when there's a we I mean today she was very motive in her thankfulness for me just being present to help her get some of the moving stuff more sorted. And yet I think the behavior is still in a position where there's not much reciprocation which does admittedly make it easier to back away and I still just do want to check in with her and see if she's okay and how she's feeling and I guess understand what I want out of the friendship. Maybe that's it.

Adding on to yesterday

Was kinda nice to leave this house behind. [[Mischa LN]]’s exit was not super elegant. He dipped a lot of things on me to finish and then want super on getting the things done.

Switched planes, maybe didn’t need to leave. 

I have a lot of new memories of pdx and am thankful for my time here. I still want to understand my irrational 

M mentioned something about what we all want add that here. Something around all any of us want … 

I want to start looking back on life and seeing more of the good and less of the bad. 

I still rember Pam saying how she felt we were comparable. It’s hard to forget that. 

I still feel that what I shared with Melissia is true in how feeling we could circle back to one another. I think the hard things is I know what Kelly and I are. But some how it still feels like I don’t know what Pam and I are. It’s different. And I wish that felt more resolved. Would like to know how to make that feel more normalized. Or how to feel comfortable with the ambiguity. Ultimately I think she is a new type of love for me and there is something to learn from that. 

But honoring the conversation with Melissia I do feel energy shifting.  It make me happy and sad. It’s starting to feel like my energy is moving again. Makes me wonder how to be in balance with some one like a partner. I feel I need to be better at honoring my self and loving myself. While feeling connected to others. 

Lots of loose thoughts

I think I would be a really happy stay at home dad. #goals 

Anyhow enough reflection.
