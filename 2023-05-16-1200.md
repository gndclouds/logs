Working on some client work focused on updates to the architecture of their product. The scope was intended only to be visual, but it feels more like there is an information architectural problem that more than visual design alone will be needed. The relationship between the information presented as relevant to parents and child objects needs new ways of navigating and filtering between them.

The difficulty is each deployment is customized to the client heavily since they are still finding the sweet spot for the product. This means when I'm working on a table, for example, I need to list parameters like a _table could contain 4-8 columns with 20 rows before pagination_. It's a very different way of creating spec docs from what I'm used to. But the need to spend time on information architecture is a compelling way to think through the project.
