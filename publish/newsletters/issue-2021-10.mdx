# Learnings:

Balancing self-generated chaos → The last few months have been the busiest since college, but the workload feels manageable because of the overlap and synchronicities between the projects. The biggest challenge has been coding all the time and finding ways to contribute to projects without me being in the coding mode 24/7. I do think that each project has put me into a productive flow state for most of the day, although I think that state would be maintained more easily if I didn't need to go into the office.

Reduct.Video → This is my 6th week as a frontend developer at Reduct. It's been kinda a rough start as the team doesn't communicate a lot so it's taking time to better understand what parts of the product I can take ownership over without burning out. It's reinforced to me that I need to double down on coding fundamentals to better communicate with the rest of the team. I think when you can google yourself out of a problem 80% of the time you forget to learn the fundamental structure. So I have been going back to the basics a little.

Dark Matter Labs → This is week 3 at DML and it's been the most comprehensive onboarding I have ever had to a new company. They are Notion ninjas, and it's hella impressive. I'm working on the Viable Cities 2030 project as a design technologist, which has thus far been a perfect blend of design and development for me.

# Conversations:

The last big update this month is me forming a climate company called Anthropogenic. We waiting for some paperwork to be completed but the startup process lead to be reconnecting with a lot of mentors this past month as I worked through what my founder equity split would be.

# Creations:

Nothing polished enough to share yet, but soon.

# Recommendations:

How a Young Activist Is Helping Pope Francis Battle Climate Change shows the value in looking at the scale of the issue you are trying to access. Sometimes you can overlook the scale of your impact but making assumptions about their constraints.

Uncle Pete is a member of Multiverse and has been creating a delightful collection of narratives and interactive posts which bring joy to my day.
