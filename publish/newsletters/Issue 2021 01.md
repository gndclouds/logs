Hey, welcome to the newsletter. I tend to not write much at the moment and wanted to find a way to keep friends, family, and collaborators in the loop. My goal is to have this be a [different pace of conversation](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Pace-layering-for-communication-and-messaging-6MiaurO6u6l9g9SDkqO8O), one that’s slower than Twitter, but faster than my typical blogging pace. The structure I want to experiment with over time but the current starting categories of thought organization will be Learnings, Conversation (coming next issue), Creations, and Recommendations. So here we go.

## Learnings:

January has become the month of milestones, software rabbit holes, and future planning. I have been freelancing for a few years and the work tends to always feel like a means to an end. And mid-last year I started making some more personally focused tools but hit frequent technical roadblocks along the way. This month a few of those were finally surpassed. I have started to have a decent working understanding of how to better pass data from the frontend of a website to the backend or server of a project. Which has allowed me to resurface a list of previously [parked projects](https://park.gndclouds.cc/) and will now allow me to start charging for a few of them.

## Creations:

[TinyFactories](https://tinyfactories.space/) - A few years ago I started a group of Indiepreneurs with [Weiwei](https://weiweihsu.com/) and [Tomo](https://www.tomokihara.com/). This past year the group really started to grow as it filled the need for a studio-like space during the pandemic. We took this chance to do a refresh the group’s goals, aspirations, and directions.

[Exploration around Solar Energy Capture](https://gndclouds.cc/posts/exploration-around-solar-energy-capture/) - In 2019 I wanted to start writing more about climate mitigation through small explorations of how we could augment existing systems. The first article was focused on [Modifying Waste Bins to be Weighable](https://reading.supply/@gndclouds/20200114-c3qoxb) and then I promptly stopped writing. So this is me kicking off this writing process for a second time.

## **Recommendations:**

[The Knowledge Project Ep. #102](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/sendhil-mullainathan/) - I tend to get stuck in the specialist or generalist argument, although I currently lean more generalists. The show’s guest [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendhil_Mullainathan) does a nice job of breaking down boundaries and goal alignment regardless of the correlations between industry and background.

[This Could Be Our Future](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/591594/this-could-be-our-future-by-yancey-strickler/) by [Yancey Strickler](https://www.ystrickler.com/) - I tend to watch a lot of SciFi which tends to have a rather gloomy perspective most of the time. So this book was a very refreshing look at how we can build the future we want to see. You're not crazy for having a big dream. You just need to stay hungry and determined.

[Mastering the Microbiome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjeS0Q-KDvc) - The focus of this episode is around how we need to balance what’s in our body’s microbiome and it sparked a cascading series of thoughts for me around who is thinking about the earth’s microbiome?

That’s it! more to come next issue. Now off to get some tea.
