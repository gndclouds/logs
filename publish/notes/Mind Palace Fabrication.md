Some way of referring to or defining the direction of these projects:

1. **Physical Computing**: This refers to the creation of interactive systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. An example might be creating a device that lights up or moves based on certain tweets or digital triggers.

2. **Tangible User Interfaces (TUI)**: This concept involves interfaces where physical objects are manipulated to control digital information. For instance, if a digital model is manipulated by moving a physical object, it's using a TUI.

3. **Tangible Media**: This can also be applied here, as it involves the broader idea of converting digital interactions or data into physical experiences or objects.

4. **Digital Fabrication**: If you're talking about "printing" a 3D representation of a digital object using something like a 3D printer, then this term applies. It involves creating physical objects from digital models.

5. **Data Sculpture or Data Physicalization**: If the intention is to represent digital data (like stats from a Twitter feed) as a physical object, then it's called data sculpture or physicalization. This is a way to represent data in a tangible form.

The specific term or concept you'd use largely depends on the nature and purpose of converting the digital object to a physical form. If it's artistic, "Data Sculpture" might be appropriate. If it's functional, terms like "Tangible User Interface" or "Digital Fabrication" might be more relevant.
