Ok so IDK how this will all be relevant but going to compile what I have learned about **soil and trees** and log it all here to try to surface some more questions for Melissa and Alison.

*I think I'm  to learn from Trees and Apply that system to soil.*

# Measurement Practices and Standards


>Scientists employ a process called “downscaling” to translate coarse-resolution climate projections into higher-resolution climate data at a scale that resolves the most influential climatic variations and removes biases with respect to historical observations. In general terms, statistical downscaling involves “training” a model on the statistical relationship between a GCM and an observational dataset over a historical period, and then applying that model to generate future predictions.4 The downscaled data can then provide input into downstream impact models and risk assessment (Figure 2).[^1]

National Space agencies are using data lights to fill in the gaps in global climate models (GCM's). NASA's [OCO-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Carbon_Observatory_2) and Japan's [GOSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_Gases_Observing_Satellite) are two of the leaders in the measurement space.


## Mapping

[[places/Archive/CarbonPlan]] and [[SoilGrid]] practice downscaling as a way to compensate for a lack of data density around soil measurement areas.

>GCMs subdivide the planet into pixels and yield a projection of the future climate for each pixel on every day. Depending on the GCM, a pixel might be ~1-2 deg on a side, or about 100-200 km at the equator.[^1]

It could be interesting to attend this conference at some point, but I feel like it, and the [[Standardised Soil Profile Data to Support Global Mapping and Modelling]] both are showing the need for better tooling to communicate hot measurement, data representation, data sharing, and collaboration are taking place. I think whatever it is we build will need to enable focus on connecting the "standards" for measuring soil with new stakeholders and scientists who need better/different data sets for their research. So maybe we need to be funding the collection or papers that collect the gaps in data we feel are needed?

>**Infrastructure for sense-making** because what gets imagined needs collectively interpreting and translating. [^6]

>**Infrastructure for content creation** because what gets imagined and then interpreted and translated needs documenting, visualizing, socializing. Practices also need documenting and sharing into a commons.[^6]

>**Infrastructure for developing practices** for collective imagination, like the Community of Practice we’ve created.[^6]


[[Planet Scale]] is working on releasing hyperspectral imaging on their satellites at a — pixel to — better resolution. So I’m thinking we could work on modeling environments more at a component level. Maybe we don’t look at an ‘ecosystem’ but instead, we model a 5x5 meter plot with a mix of live sensor data and secondary data light satellite images.



## Standards

Still looking into the standards used, but there are two (SOUCE) very manual ways of accounting for soil sample collection. There was a [[U.S. Soil Enrichment Protocol]] created, but it looks like there is some controversy[^5] around the organization that funded the research, according to [[places/Archive/CarbonPlan]]. In [[A buyer’s guide to soil carbon offsets]] they reference how most existing protocols focus specifically on identifying how much carbon is captured they don't necessarily account for total soil health. This seems to be because the focus is around carbon sequestration through agriculture and emergent funding around that through the purchasing of carbon offsets. However, I'm still looking for a standard, which specifically identifies the soil health, or by the regional health of an ecosystem in a way that is measured. They later published and additional changes in *[[Additions to Our Analysis of Soil Carbon Protocols]]* they recommended some updates to the protocols.

[[Pony Earth]] is working on collecting data from farms and using the data to make *reart* as a way to fund the project and work on regenerating farms

## Sampling

There is a project called world forest ID which is using [stable isotope testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_isotope_ratio) to identify were and when wood is illegally harvested. The [Forest Stewardship Council](https://fsc.org/en) has been using this as part of their work to certify and trace source materials in commonly exploited portions of the wood industry.

Would there be value in doing this with soils? could't you identify where every natureal material in the world originated? Wouldn't this solve a major issue with supply chain traceability. And support a project like [[Planned Obsolescence Protocol $POP]]?

You could start with un geotagged samples  from national archives around the world to create a baseline data set. Then we can use a model based on the signature and compare them to the data sets you also actively collected. Maybe we can lear something too from how [Forensic Architecture (FA)](https://forensic-architecture.org) structures and measures there group.


What would be impact be of working on legislation to force DARPA to offset their emissions?


# Soil Health

> There are also major climate benefits. Soil holds more carbon in it than all living vegetation and the atmosphere put together.[^4]

Forever Chemicals are impacting a lot agriculture systems [^2][^3] but the sludge they are in often is not regulated in the same way as fertilizers. But some states like #Maine and #place/Michigan are starting to limit or hult the practice all together. Sludge can also be as much as 1%[^3] of total sledge weight.

## Project Ideas

- Replenish soil health through we want to rewild
- Defraud the carbon offset market, through better standards, and monitoring of change in CO to sequestration in the soil of forests
- Create a database of soil samples that are verified based on properties found in [[Systematic Stable Isotope Testing]], similar to FSC, and their work with forests
- Model of forest and is close to a digital twin as we possibly can
- Teach farmers, how to create biodynamic farms, which replenish watersheds and restore, nutrients to soil systems
- Take down, Monsanto literally anything to take down Monsanto maybe we measure the impact of soil quality before, and after the use of their pesticides to create a class action lawsuit that communicates the captive incentive structure that Monsanto place is farmers in
- Buy a bunch of forests and allow them to own themselves based on the amount of carbon that they are sequestering by not being cut down or farmed
-




# Loose thoughts

Conservation vs reduction Redis


USDA provides around 1 billion dollars a year for conservation practices
- Focuses on soil
- NRCS and regional conversation district
