Prompt for OpenAI + ChatGPT4



```
There is so much doom and gloom around climate change. Create a short story about climate change where the main character is a ${occupation} living in ${location} in ${year}. The focus should be on how the character adapts to make the best of climate change based on the ${scenario}. The overall tone should be realistic but optimistic. I would like the story to be inspirational and hint at humans learning to become better planetary stewards in the future.
