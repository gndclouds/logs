What does it look like for a city to care for its citizens? We explored three directions in which A-Eye could help support us as we traverse daily life in our town. The first is accommodating accessibility. We think the future public service system will be more flexible. The second is family mindfulness. Today, people can receive care or The from their families or best friends in their own homes. We think that people will be able to receive care or support from the entire city in the future. The third is emotional advocate. More emotional relationships can be made between the city and its people. This is our future city concept: A-Eye City.
