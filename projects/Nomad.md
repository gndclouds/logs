Nomad is a platform developed by [Ideo CoLab](http://www.ideocolab.com/) for the purpose of increasing access to and usability of the more than 3 trillion untapped data streams. I created [developer documentation](https://weftech.gitbooks.io/nomad-quickstart-guide/content/), including narratives of applications for nomads based on emerging technologies, and developed working prototypes during workshops with clients.
