# Hello Earth


![Hello Earth](https://blog.anthropogenic.com/content/images/size/w2000/2022/06/producthunt-gallery-1.png)

As a part of the web of life, humans affect the ecosystems around us. With many of Earth’s natural systems at tipping points from climate change, there is a need for greater access to climate data- and modernization of how we use it. To easily share the most cutting-edge climate data, we created a REST API for Carbon, Nitrous Oxide, and Sulfur Hexafluoride emissions (all super important greenhouse gases).

We will continue to add data sets and better tools for visualizing the data through explorable examples.
